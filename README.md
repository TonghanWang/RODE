# RODE: Learning Roles to Decompose Multi-Agent Tasks

RODE ([ArXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01523.pdf)) is a scalable role-based multi-agent learning method which effectively discovers roles based on joint action space decomposition according to action effects. It establishes a new state of the art on the StarCraft multi-agent benchmark.

This implementation is written in PyTorch and is based on [PyMARL](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) and [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac).

The results of RODE on the SMAC benchmark can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZUoZO2x-rNBIxhfxn9txhsc4pVReU38/view?usp=sharing).

## Installation instructions

Build the Dockerfile using 
```shell
cd docker
bash build.sh
```

Set up StarCraft II and SMAC:
```shell
bash install_sc2.sh
```

This will download SC2 into the 3rdparty folder and copy the maps necessary to run over.

The requirements.txt file can be used to install the necessary packages into a virtual environment (not recomended).

## Run an experiment 

```shell
python3 src/main.py --config=rode --env-config=sc2 with env_args.map_name=corridor n_role_clusters=3 role_interval=5 t_max=5050000
```

To change the annealing time of epsilon, set `epsilon_anneal_time_exp`.

All results will be stored in the `Results` folder.

## Saving and loading learnt models

### Saving models

You can save the learnt models to disk by setting `save_model = True`, which is set to `False` by default. The frequency of saving models can be adjusted using `save_model_interval` configuration. Models will be saved in the result directory, under the folder called *models*. The directory corresponding each run will contain models saved throughout the experiment, each within a folder corresponding to the number of timesteps passed since starting the learning process.

### Loading models

Learnt models can be loaded using the `checkpoint_path` parameter, after which the learning will proceed from the corresponding timestep. 

## Watching StarCraft II replays

`save_replay` option allows saving replays of models which are loaded using `checkpoint_path`. Once the model is successfully loaded, `test_nepisode` number of episodes are run on the test mode and a .SC2Replay file is saved in the Replay directory of StarCraft II. Please make sure to use the episode runner if you wish to save a replay, i.e., `runner=episode`. The name of the saved replay file starts with the given `env_args.save_replay_prefix` (map_name if empty), followed by the current timestamp. 

**Note:** Replays cannot be watched using the Linux version of StarCraft II. Please use either the Mac or Windows version of the StarCraft II client.
